# Training-Csharp
 
Task list:

Level Easy:
1. Find Y if "Y = X1 + X2 + ... + Xn", "X = Z ^ 3 - B + A ^ 2 / tg ^ 2". The number X is entered by the user of the program. For each X, the values ​​of Z, B, A are different (entered by the user of the program).
2. Organize the input of a two-digit natural number from the keyboard. The program should determine the lowest and highest digits.
3. Raise a number entered from the keyboard to the power n, the degree is also entered from the keyboard. Arranging using cycles. (Without using "Math.Pow")
4. Create an algorithm that determines whether the digits of the entered three-digit number are the same. The number is entered from the keyboard.
5. Write a program that allows the user to enter into the console the three coordinates of the vector x, y, and z, with the base at the origin. Calculate the length of this vector and print it.
6. Create a program that should receive a sequence of digits at the input, after which the program displays a digit whose serial number has been entered by the user.
7. Compose a test program on the screen in turn there are questions with answers. At the end of the work, the program gives out the number of points earned according to the results of the answer.
8. Using the “while” loop, develop a program that calculates a multiple of 5. Set the loop from 0 to the number entered from the keyboard.
9. Write a program that should determine if the brick will go into the hole. The hole dimensions (length and height) are entered by the user. The same applies to the dimensions of the brick, the user enters into the program the values ​​of the length, width and height of the brick.
10. The program checks whether the number entered from the keyboard is an integer.

Level Normal:
1. In a text file containing the text of the C program, check the correspondence between the opening and closing curly braces {and}.
2. Given an array of size "n", fill it with random numbers, Find all the odd numbers in the array.
3. Convert time (user manually sets hours, minutes and seconds) to seconds and vice versa seconds to hours, minutes, seconds.
4. Create a class that describes the concept of an employee, with the following properties: Name; experience; hourly wage; number of hours worked.
5. Write a function that calculates the arithmetic mean of the whole array.

Level Hard:
1. Develop a program for processing matrices. The program must perform the following actions to choose from: sum, subtract, multiply two matrices. Matrices must be stored in two different files. That is, when starting the program, it is necessary to read two matrices from the files and after that make calculations.
2. Describe the prism class: volume, height, number of faces, length of sides, base area. Implement get and set methods for working with class data elements. Organize selection (menu) of input and output data. Protect the prism data element from external codes.
3. Develop three classes that should be linked together using inheritance: 1) Product class, which has three data elements - name, price and weight of the product (base class for all classes); 2) the Buy class, which contains data on the quantity of purchased goods in pieces, on the price for all purchased goods and on the weight of the goods (derived class for the Product class and base class for the Check class); 3) class Check, which does not contain any data element. This class should display information about the product and about the purchase (derived class for the Buy class);

Level Experienced:
1. Develop a program to convert numbers from a digital record to a string. For example, 134345 would be "one hundred thirty four thousand three hundred forty five." The algorithm should work for an arbitrarily large number, respectively, the values ​​of the degrees - one million, one thousand, one billion, etc. - must be taken from a directory, for example, a text file.
